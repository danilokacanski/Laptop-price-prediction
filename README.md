# Laptop-price-prediction
A machine learning project aimed at predicting laptop prices based on various features, transforming non-numeric data into numerical representations to enhance model accuracy.

This project focuses on predicting laptop prices using machine learning techniques, with a dataset containing both numeric and categorical features such as brand, processor type, and operating system. To ensure the model could process all features effectively, every non-numeric attribute was transformed into numeric dummy variables, preserving their unique information while making them suitable for model training. Various algorithms, including linear regression and random forests, were employed, and model performance was evaluated using RMSE to achieve optimal price predictions.
